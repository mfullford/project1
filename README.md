# Pet A Puppy

The idea for my Project 1 is a game that involves:

- A moving background
- A left-right moving protagonist
- Lots of puppies

The puppies will be "running" towards the bottom of the screen while the protagonist moves to try and pet as many puppies as possible within the 30 second timeline.
