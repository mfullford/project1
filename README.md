# Game of Thrones Trivia

The idea for my Project 1 is a trivia style game. It will be in a grid and once you click on the grid, the question will pop up with 4 potential answers. Once the player chooses one, it will display whether or not the answer was correct and if it was correct, it will add a point to the total score for that player. Once all questions have been answered, the winner will be announced.

----- Plan B------


# Pet A Puppy

The idea for my Project 1 is a game that involves:

- A moving background
- A left-right moving protagonist
- Lots of puppies

The puppies will be "running" towards the bottom of the screen while the protagonist moves to try and pet as many puppies as possible within the 30 second timeline. Once that 30 seconds is over, Player 2 will have a chance to pet as many puppies as possible within the same time frame. Whoever pets more puppies, wins!
