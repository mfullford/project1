# Pet A Puppy

The idea for my Project 1 is a game that involves:

- A moving background
- A left-right moving protagonist
- Lots of puppies

The puppies will be "running" towards the bottom of the screen while the protagonist moves to try and pet as many puppies as possible within the 30 second timeline. Once that 30 seconds is over, Player 2 will have a chance to pet as many puppies as possible within the same time frame. Whoever pets more puppies, wins!
